# ArrayMethodTesting
Watch and Code test driven development exercises.  The goal of each exercise is to recreate native javascript array methods using test driven development.  Each method will have it's own .html file and will utilize jstinytest as it's testing software.  In my case I am using my varient of jstinytest, jstinytest_dom_edition.
  
Note: Index.html is the current file being worked on, this is a feature of glitch.com which renders only index.html
